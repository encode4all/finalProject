# Encode Neo X Hackathon project  

This project is an NFT <> RealWorld Art Project mirror.
The deployed contracts and frontend are to facilitate the interaction with the smart contracts and view the nft. 

The nft has a recover function, which is a crypthographic 1 way function to recover the asset in case the NFT is stolen/transfered because of a hack / social engineering etcetera.
The secret to succesfully call this 1 way cryptographic function is hidden away in the real world art piece.
